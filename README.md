IPAMS
=============

A Ruby on Rails (RoR) based IP Address Management System. 基于Ruby on Rails (RoR)的IP地址管理系统。

Status
------
* Is under intense development and far from maturity;
* Branch develop is always the most rececent commit;
* ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) is under folder architecture & drawn with Dia;
* Supports only IPv4 at present.
 
How-tos
------
* git clone https://github.com/guanglindu/ipams.git
* rake db:migrate
* rake db:seed (Note: for development only; for production, please create or import the VLAN data.)
* rake init:vlans (rake init:VLAN-NAME to initialize a specific VLAN)
* start the server locally: rails server
* Browse it locally: http://localhost:3000

Importing Existing Data (Administrators only)
------
* Importing templates reside public/downloads. The data should be exported in UTF-8 encoded CSV files with the same file base name as the templates and copied to fold tmp.
* File tmp/IMPORT_LOG.txt updates after each import.
* File tmp/IMPORT_DIFF.html shows the difference if there're conflicts in the IP address importing.
* The update attribute is optional in the IP address importing template to tell the importer to import this record anyway.
* On a terminal at folder ipams, use command 'rake --tasks' to show the available IPAMS-specific tasks.
