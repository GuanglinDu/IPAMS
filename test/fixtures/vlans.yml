# Read about fixtures at http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html

# Label references for associations (belongs_to, has_one, has_many)
# Specifying foreign keys in fixtures can be very fragile, not to mention difficult to read.
# Since Active Record can figure out the ID of any fixture from its label, you can specify FK's by label instead of ID.
